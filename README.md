About the Indian Fortune Prediction Game
I've created a culturally-themed fortune prediction game inspired by Indian traditions, symbols, and wisdom. Here's what makes this game special:
Cultural Elements Included

Chakra System: The game uses the traditional seven chakras plus two additional spiritual concepts from Indian philosophy as the selection mechanism.
Indian-Inspired Fortunes: All predictions incorporate:

References to Indian mythology (Krishna, Rama, Durga)
Natural elements important in Indian culture (lotus, Himalayas, Ganga river)
Traditional celebrations (Holi, rangoli)
Philosophical concepts (karma, dharma)


Visual Design:

Warm color palette inspired by Indian textiles and spices
Traditional chakra colors
Sanskrit title "भविष्य दर्शन" (Future Vision)



Game Features

Interactive Fortune Reading: Users think of a question and select a chakra stone to receive their prediction
24 Unique Fortunes: Each with culturally authentic wisdom and guidance
Responsive Design: Works on mobile devices and desktop browsers
Simple Interface: Easy to understand and navigate
